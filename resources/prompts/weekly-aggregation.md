Right now the aggregation is done on 1 month, 3 months and 
12 months and it is being maintained in three separate 
columns. 

but now I want to have a different schema.
for each month the data for that month should be aggregated 
and the business date should be the latest business date for
that month.

ask me three important questions about the requirement that 
will help you build the solution more efficiently

================
Answers (Iteration 1):
 1. Week Definition and Boundaries
  - How should we define a week - ISO weeks (Monday-Sunday),
  Sunday-Saturday, or another convention? -> Monday-Sunday
  - For the business_date assignment per week, should it be:
    - The last actual business date found in that week's data? -> Yes
    - The last day of the week (e.g., Sunday for ISO weeks)? -> No
    - The first day of the week? -> No
  - How should we handle partial weeks at the beginning/end of
   the data (e.g., if data starts on a Wednesday)? -> Consider data From Wednesday till Sunday

  2. Output Structure and Time Range
  - Should each row represent one week's aggregation for a
  given composite key, meaning we'll have multiple rows per
  key (one for each week)? -> Yes
  - When the user specifies N weeks via command line, should
  we:
    - Generate rows for the last N weeks from the latest
  business date? -> No
    - Generate rows for ALL weeks in the data, but only
  include metrics calculated from the last N weeks? -> No
    - Something else? -> Yes. Lets say if a user inputs 2 weeks then it should mean that data should be aggregated in 2 weeks. So all the business dates should be combined into 1 while aggregating the values and the new business date representing all the merged business dates should be the latest business date in those 2 weeks.
  - Should weeks with no data still appear in the output with
  zero counts, or be omitted? - omitted

  3. Aggregation Scope and Metrics
  - For each weekly row, should it contain:
    - Only that specific week's counts (pass/fail/warn for
  just those 7 days)? -> yes
    - Rolling metrics up to that week (cumulative from N weeks
   ago)? -> Lets say if a user inputs 2 weeks then it should mean that data should be aggregated in 2 weeks. So all the business dates should be combined into 1 while aggregating the values and the new business date representing all the merged business dates should be the latest business date in those 2 weeks.
  - Should we still calculate fail rates and trends, but now
  on a weekly basis? -> yes. since each n weeks will be combined into one then calculate fail rates in those n weeks and for trends just compare the failure rate against its previous grouped week fail rate.
  - Do you need week-over-week comparison metrics (e.g.,
  comparing this week's fail rate to last week's)? -> Yes
