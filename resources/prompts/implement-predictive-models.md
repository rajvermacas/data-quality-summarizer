I just want to have a design discussion with you. Once we agree on the design you can create a markdown PRD and save it in the resources folder under prd.

I want to implement a predictive model for data quality. What I want is a solution where input will be a rule_code and a business_date and output will be the predicted pass percentage for that rule_code and business_date. You can look into large_test.csv to have a better understanding of the data.
