## Executive Summary

This development plan outlines a 5-stage Agile approach for building a web-based UI for the Data Quality Summarizer system. Following MVP-first principles, we'll deliver a functional product in Stage 1 (2-3 weeks) that addresses the core user need: **visualizing data quality metrics and processing CSV files through an intuitive interface**. Each subsequent stage adds features based on user feedback and business value, ensuring continuous delivery of working software.

The plan emphasizes rapid iteration, user feedback integration, and incremental enhancement. By starting with a minimal but complete solution, we reduce time-to-market and validate assumptions early, allowing for course corrections based on real user experiences rather than speculation.

## MVP Definition & Rationale

### Core Problem
Data quality analysts currently rely on command-line tools to process CSV files and interpret text-based outputs, making it difficult to quickly identify trends, failures, and patterns in data quality metrics.

### Essential Features (Stage 1 MVP)
- **File Upload**: Web-based CSV upload with progress indicator
- **Processing**: Integration with existing backend processing engine
- **Basic Dashboard**: Key metrics visualization (pass/fail rates, trend indicators)
- **Results Viewer**: Tabular display of processed summaries
- **Export**: Download processed results as CSV

### Success Metrics
- Processing time < 3 minutes for 100k rows
- Zero failed uploads for valid CSV files
- User can complete full workflow (upload → process → view → export) < 5 clicks
- 90% of users successfully process their first file without assistance

### Primary User Persona
**Data Quality Analyst** - Monitors daily data quality metrics, needs quick visual insights into failures and trends without technical expertise.

## Technology Stack Overview

### MVP Stack (Minimal Dependencies)
- **Frontend**: React with Vite (fast build, minimal config)
- **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS + Headless UI (lightweight, accessible)
- **Charts**: Recharts (simple, declarative API)
- **State**: React Context (built-in, no external deps)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (existing Python ecosystem)
- **File Handling**: Streaming multipart upload

### Future Enhancements (Stages 2-5)
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Advanced state management (Zustand)
- Authentication (NextAuth.js)
- Enhanced visualizations (D3.js)
- Progressive Web App capabilities
