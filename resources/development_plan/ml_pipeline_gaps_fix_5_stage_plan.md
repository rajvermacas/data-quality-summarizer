- **Scalability:** Linear scaling up to 8 cores

### Business Metrics
- **Feature Engineering Consistency:** 100% feature match between training/prediction
- **Production Readiness:** Pass all integration tests
- **Maintainability:** All files <800 lines, clear documentation
- **User Experience:** Intuitive CLI with helpful error messages

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **Begin Stage 1 implementation** focusing on feature engineering fixes
2. **Set up enhanced integration testing framework**
3. **Establish performance monitoring baseline**

### Development Process
1. **Daily TDD cycles** - Red-Green-Refactor for each feature
2. **Weekly stage reviews** - Validate completion criteria
3. **Continuous integration** - Automated testing on every commit

### Success Validation
1. **End-to-end testing** after each stage
2. **Performance benchmarking** weekly
3. **User acceptance testing** before stage completion
