- **Coverage**: 93% (14 tests passing)
- **Key Features**:
  - Accumulator with composite key: `(source, tenant_id, dataset_uuid, dataset_name, rule_code)`
  - Rolling windows: 1-month (30d), 3-month (90d), 12-month (365d) from latest business_date
  - Pass/fail count tracking from JSON results with robust error handling
  - Trend calculations: fail rate comparisons with epsilon threshold (â†‘/â†“/=)
  - Memory-efficient design staying under 50MB for accumulator
  - Comprehensive edge case handling (malformed JSON, invalid dates)

#### Stage 4: Summary Generation & Export âœ… **NEW**
- **Completed**: CSV and natural language artifact generation
- **Files**: `src/summarizer.py`, `tests/test_summarizer.py`
- **Coverage**: 91% (13 tests passing)
- **Key Features**:
  - Full summary CSV with exact 27-column schema as per requirements
  - Natural language sentence generation following precise template format
  - File output to configurable directory (`resource/artifacts/` default)
  - UTF-8 encoding support for international characters
  - Memory-efficient processing with <2MB output file size validation
  - Comprehensive error handling and structured logging
  - Empty data handling and permission error management

### Current Test Status
- **Total Tests**: 51 tests passing (13 new Stage 4 + 38 previous)
- **Overall Coverage**: 93% (exceeds 80% requirement)
- **No Regressions**: All Stage 1, 2, and 3 tests continue to pass
- **Quality Standards**: All modules maintain high code quality with comprehensive TDD implementation

### Development Environment
- **Python**: 3.12.3 in virtual environment
- **Key Dependencies**: pandas, pytest, pytest-cov
- **Project Structure**: 
  ```
  src/
    - __init__.py
    - ingestion.py (Stage 1)
    - rules.py (Stage 2)
    - aggregator.py (Stage 3)
    - summarizer.py (Stage 4) âœ¨ NEW
  tests/
    - test_ingestion.py (Stage 1)
    - test_rules.py (Stage 2)
    - test_aggregator.py (Stage 3)
    - test_summarizer.py (Stage 4) âœ¨ NEW
  ```

### Next Stage Ready: Stage 5 - CLI Integration & End-to-End Testing
- **Focus**: Command-line interface and complete pipeline integration
- **Key Components**:
  - `src/__main__.py` - CLI entry point and pipeline orchestration
  - Complete end-to-end workflow from CSV input to summary artifacts
  - Performance monitoring and final optimizations
  - Integration testing with realistic datasets

### Stage 4 Implementation Highlights
- **Architecture**: Clean `SummaryGenerator` class with clear separation of concerns
- **CSV Export**: Exact 27-column schema implementation with all required fields
- **NL Generation**: Precise template following: `â€¢ On {date}, dataset "{name}" under rule "{rule}" [{code}] recorded {failures} failures and {passes} passes overall (fail-rate {rate}; 1-month {1m}, 3-month {3m}, 12-month {12m}) â€” trend {trend}.`
- **File Management**: Robust directory creation and UTF-8 encoding support
- **Performance**: Memory-efficient processing staying well under 2MB output limits
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception management with structured logging

### TDD Process Followed
- **RED**: Write failing tests first to drive implementation (âœ… 13 tests initially failed)  
- **GREEN**: Implement minimal code to pass tests (âœ… All 13 tests passing)
- **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality while maintaining test coverage (âœ… 91% coverage achieved)
- Each stage achieves >80% test coverage requirement with comprehensive edge case testing

### Code Quality Standards Met
- **File Size**: All files <800 lines (summarizer.py = 67 lines)
- **Function Size**: 10-30 lines average, max 40 lines (well under 80-line limit)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings and type hints throughout
- **Error Handling**: Robust exception handling with structured logging
- **Logging**: Appropriate levels (INFO for progress, DEBUG for details, WARNING for issues)
- **Performance**: Optimized data structures meeting memory and speed requirements

### Key Design Patterns
- **Streaming Processing**: Chunked data processing for memory efficiency
- **Composite Key Aggregation**: Efficient grouping by `(source, tenant, dataset, rule)` tuple
- **Time Window Analysis**: Rolling calculations from latest business_date anchor
- **Template-Based Generation**: Exact NL sentence formatting for LLM consumption
- **Directory Management**: Safe path handling with proper error boundaries
