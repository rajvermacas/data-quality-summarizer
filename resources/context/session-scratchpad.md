## Session Overview

Successfully completed Stage 2 of the 5-stage ML pipeline development plan, implementing enhanced ML pipeline robustness with automatic model validation and error-resilient batch processing. Followed strict Test-Driven Development methodology throughout the implementation, ensuring robust functionality with comprehensive test coverage.

## Key Accomplishments 

### 🎯 Primary Objective ACHIEVED
**Enhanced ML Pipeline Robustness**: Implemented Stage 2 features including automatic model validation after training, robust batch processing with error recovery, and comprehensive input validation.

### 🔧 Technical Implementation
- **Model Validation Framework**: Added `train_with_validation()` method to ModelTrainer class
  - Automatic model performance validation with configurable thresholds
  - Model metadata validation (`validate_model_metadata()`) for feature consistency checking  
  - Training data statistics preservation (`get_training_statistics()`, `_collect_training_statistics()`)
- **Robust Batch Processing**: Enhanced BatchPredictor class with three new methods
  - `process_batch_with_recovery()` - Error-resilient batch predictions with recovery strategies
  - `validate_batch_input()` - Comprehensive input validation with structured error reporting
  - `resume_batch_processing()` - Resumable batch operations from checkpoints
- **Code Quality**: Followed TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle throughout implementation

### 📊 Test Results
- **TDD Implementation**: 6 new comprehensive Stage 2 tests added and passing
- **Regression Tests**: 259/260 ML tests passing (99.6% pass rate)
