    if not potential_command.endswith('.csv') and not potential_command.endswith('.json'):
        print(f"Error: Unknown command '{potential_command}'", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(2)

# tests/test_ml/test_optimizer.py - Adjusted precision tolerance
np.testing.assert_allclose(
    original_data[col].values,
