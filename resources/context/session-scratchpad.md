### Files Modified/Created
```
src/data_quality_summarizer/ml/model_trainer.py          # ENHANCED - Added 5 new functions
tests/test_stage2_enhanced_features.py                   # NEW - 11 test cases
resources/development_plan/...                           # UPDATED - Stage 2 completion status
```

### Critical Problem Addressed
**Original Issue**: ML model consistently predicted 0.0% for ALL inputs (MAE: 51.9%)  
**Root Cause**: Data preprocessing issues, inadequate feature engineering, poor model configuration  
**Stage 1 Solution**: Comprehensive data validation gates prevent training on poor-quality data  
**Stage 2 Solution**: Optimized LightGBM parameters and enhanced training diagnostics

## Important Context

### Development Environment
- **Working Directory**: `/root/projects/data-quality-summarizer`
- **Virtual Environment**: Configured with all dependencies
- **Python Version**: 3.12.3
- **Key Dependencies**: LightGBM, pandas, numpy, pytest, structlog

### Test Commands
```bash
# Run Stage 2 enhanced tests
python -m pytest tests/test_stage2_enhanced_features.py -v

# Full regression testing (380 tests)
python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing -v

# Enhanced model training example
python -c "
from src.data_quality_summarizer.ml.model_trainer import train_lightgbm_model_with_enhanced_diagnostics
# Use with real data and see comprehensive diagnostics in action
"
```

### Stage 2 Key Functions
```python
# Optimized model configuration
get_optimized_lgb_params() -> Dict[str, Any]

# Enhanced training with diagnostics
train_lightgbm_model_with_enhanced_diagnostics(
    data, feature_cols, categorical_cols, target_col, use_optimized_params=True
) -> Dict[str, Any]

# Feature importance analysis
log_feature_importance_analysis(model, feature_names) -> Dict[str, Any]

# Training convergence monitoring
generate_training_convergence_report(
    eval_results, target_rounds, actual_rounds
) -> Dict[str, Any]

# Complete Stage 1+2 integration
train_lightgbm_model_with_validation_and_diagnostics(
    data, feature_cols, categorical_cols, target_col
) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Available
1. **Stage 3 Implementation** - Prediction Pipeline Fix & Comprehensive Validation
   - Feature consistency between training and prediction
   - Prediction quality assurance (constant prediction detection)
   - End-to-end validation with MAE < 15% target
   - Comprehensive validation framework

2. **Production Validation Testing** - Test enhanced pipeline with real problematic data
   - Use `demo_subset.csv` with new Stage 2 enhanced pipeline
   - Compare results with previous 0.0% predictions
   - Validate that optimized parameters improve model learning

3. **Repository Maintenance** - Update .gitignore and create commit

### Stage 3 Requirements Preview
From development plan - next major objectives:
- **US3.1**: Consistent feature handling between training and prediction
- **US3.2**: Prediction quality assurance with constant prediction detection
- **US3.3**: Comprehensive validation with MAE < 15% target

### Success Metrics Tracking
**Target Goals** (from PRD):
- Prediction Variance: std(predictions) > 1% *(currently all 0.0%)*
- Model Accuracy: MAE < 15% *(currently 51.9%)*
- Feature Learning: >70% features with non-zero importance *(Stage 2 addresses this)*
