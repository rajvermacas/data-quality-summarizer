### CLI Integration Excellence

**Command Structure:**
```bash
# Original functionality preserved
python -m src input.csv rules.json

# New ML commands
python -m src train-model input.csv rules.json --output-model model.pkl
python -m src predict --model model.pkl --dataset-uuid uuid123 --rule-code R001 --date 2024-01-15
python -m src batch-predict --model model.pkl --input predictions.csv --output results.csv
```

**Backward Compatibility:**
- ✅ All existing CLI arguments work unchanged
- ✅ Original command format fully preserved
- ✅ Smart command detection (ML commands vs. original format)
- ✅ All existing tests pass without modification

### TDD Implementation Excellence

**Perfect Red → Green → Refactor Cycle:**
