# Data Quality Summarizer - Predictive Model Development Session

## Session Overview
**Date**: 2025-06-21
**Activity**: Planning Test-Driven Development for Predictive Model Feature
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ 5-Stage TDD Plan Approved & Saved

## Context Summary

### Project Status
- **Core System**: Production-ready data quality summarizer with 90% test coverage
- **Architecture**: 5-module streaming pipeline (ingestion â†’ aggregation â†’ rules â†’ summarizer â†’ CLI)
- **Performance**: Meets all benchmarks (<2min runtime, <1GB memory for 100k rows)
- **New Feature**: Predictive model for forecasting data quality pass percentages

### Requirements Analysis
**PRD Reviewed**: `resources/prd/predictive_model_prd.md`
- **Goal**: Predict daily pass percentage for (dataset_uuid, rule_code, business_date) combinations
- **Approach**: Regression model using LightGBM on historical execution logs
- **Input**: `large_test.csv` with rule execution history
- **Output**: Single floating-point prediction (0-100% pass rate)

### Technical Specifications
**Model Architecture:**
- **Algorithm**: LightGBM (CPU-optimized gradient boosting)
- **Problem Type**: Time-series regression (not classification)
- **Features**: Time-based + lag features + moving averages + categorical encodings
- **Evaluation**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on chronologically split test set

**Performance Requirements:**
- **Training**: <10 minutes for 100k rows on 4-core CPU
- **Memory**: <2GB peak usage during training
- **Prediction**: <100ms per single prediction, <1 minute for 1000 batch predictions
- **Hardware**: Consumer-grade, CPU-only machines

### 5-Stage TDD Development Plan
**Plan Location**: `resources/development_plan/predictive_model_5_stage_tdd_plan.md`

**Stage 1: Data Preparation & Feature Engineering**
- Data loader with JSON parsing of `results` column
- Aggregation by (dataset_uuid, rule_code, business_date)
- Time-based features (day of week, month, etc.)
- Lag features (1-day, 2-day, 7-day historical values)
- Moving averages (3-day, 7-day windows)

**Stage 2: Model Training Infrastructure**
- Chronological train/test splitting (no random splits)
- LightGBM integration with categorical feature handling
- Model serialization/deserialization
- MAE evaluation framework

**Stage 3: Prediction Service**
- Core prediction API: (dataset_uuid, rule_code, business_date) â†’ pass_percentage
- Input validation and error handling
- Historical data lookup for feature engineering
- Thread-safe service design

**Stage 4: CLI Integration**
- New CLI commands: `train-model`, `predict`, `batch-predict`
- Integration with existing `__main__.py` orchestration
- Batch prediction capabilities with CSV I/O
- Progress indicators and user-friendly error messages

**Stage 5: Production Optimization**
- Performance optimization and benchmarking
- Model validation and drift detection
- Production-grade monitoring and health checks
- Complete documentation and deployment guides

### Dependencies to Add
```toml
# pyproject.toml additions needed
lightgbm = "^4.0.0"    # Primary ML library
scikit-learn = "^1.3.0" # Additional ML utilities
```

### Success Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: >95% across all new ML modules
- **Performance**: All benchmarks consistently met
- **Code Quality**: All files <800 lines, proper mypy typing
- **Prediction Accuracy**: MAE <5% on held-out test set
- **Integration**: Seamless CLI integration without breaking existing functionality

### Current Git Status
```
Current branch: main
Modified files:
M pyproject.toml
M src/data_quality_summarizer/__main__.py
```

### Next Steps
1. Begin Stage 1: Create `src/data_quality_summarizer/ml/` module structure
2. Implement data loading and feature engineering with TDD approach
3. Add LightGBM dependencies to pyproject.toml
4. Follow Redâ†’Greenâ†’Refactor cycle for each component

## Key Technical Decisions Made

### Feature Engineering Strategy
- **Target Variable**: `pass_percentage = (SUM(is_pass) / COUNT(is_pass)) * 100`
- **Grouping Key**: `(dataset_uuid, rule_code, business_date)`
- **Time Features**: Extract from business_date (day_of_week, month, week_of_year)
- **Lag Features**: Previous 1, 2, 7 days pass percentages
- **Moving Averages**: 3-day and 7-day rolling averages

### Data Processing Approach
- **Streaming**: Process CSV in chunks to maintain memory efficiency
- **Chronological Splitting**: Train on early dates, test on later dates
- **Categorical Handling**: Use LightGBM's native categorical feature support

### Architecture Patterns
- **Module Structure**: `src/data_quality_summarizer/ml/` for all ML components
- **Separation of Concerns**: Distinct modules for data prep, training, prediction
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with comprehensive logging
- **Testing**: Unit tests + integration tests + performance benchmarks
