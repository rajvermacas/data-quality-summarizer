## Important Context

### 🔍 Stage 3 Implementation Details

**US3.1: Enhanced Model Registry**
- Model comparison with automated recommendations based on performance metrics
- Environment-aware promotion tracking (staging, production)
- Semantic version pattern matching for efficient model querying

**US3.2: Hyperparameter Optimization**
- Multiple optimization strategies: grid search (exhaustive), random search (efficient), Bayesian optimization (intelligent)
- Time-bounded execution with configurable limits to prevent runaway optimization
- Cross-validation integration with proper categorical feature handling for LightGBM

**US3.3: A/B Testing Framework**
- Complete experiment lifecycle management with persistent storage
- Consistent hashing ensures same user always gets same treatment assignment
- Statistical significance testing with confidence intervals, effect size, and power analysis

### 🏛️ Architecture Notes
- **Clean Integration**: All new features integrate seamlessly with existing ProductionUtils infrastructure
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing APIs and functionality preserved
- **SOLID Principles**: Implementation follows single responsibility and separation of concerns
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with structured error reporting and graceful degradation

### 🧪 Test Infrastructure
- **TDD Compliance**: All features implemented using Red-Green-Refactor methodology
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests validate both success scenarios and edge cases
- **Integration Focus**: Tests verify end-to-end functionality, not just unit behavior
- **Regression Prevention**: Full test suite ensures new features don't break existing functionality
